        <p>

            I'm Keanu Thompson, a university student pursuing a Bachelor of Science
            in Information Technology. I have strong skills in programming, database
            management and descriptive writing and I enjoy working with languages
            like PHP, C# and Java. Most of my projects focus on web development,
            object-oriented programming and database design. Beyond academics, I'm
            deeply interested in financial trading, especially forex and the stock market.
            I also explore cultural and academic research, including the Black Power Era,
            Caribbean cyberculture and entertainment law. I see myself as detail-oriented,
            analytical and goal-driven, with a balance of technical expertise and critical,
            creative thinking.

        <p>

            I'm interested in web development because it allows me to combine my technical
            skills in programming and database design with my creativity in building practical,
            real-world solutions. I enjoy structuring projects efficiently, working with
            languages like PHP and Javascript and exploring frameworks that make applications
            both functional and user-friendly. For me, web development is a way to bring ideas
            to life, showcase problem-solving and continuously improve through optimization and
            design.
