        <p>

            I'm Keanu Thompson, a university student pursuing a Bachelor of Science
            in Information Technology. I have strong skills in programming, database
            management, and descriptive writing, and I enjoy working with languages
            like PHP, C#, and Java. Most of my projects focus on web development,
            object-oriented programming, and database design. Beyond academics, I'm
            deeply interested in financial trading, especially forex and the stock market.
            I also explore cultural and academic research, including the Black Power Era,
            Caribbean cyberculture, and entertainment law. I see myself as detail-oriented,
            analytical, and goal-driven, with a balance of technical expertise and critical,
            creative thinking.
